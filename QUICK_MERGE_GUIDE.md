# Quick Merge Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Current Status ✅
- Your work is backed up in `backup-before-merge` branch
- You're working on `merge-partner-changes` branch
- All your current changes are safe

## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Get Partner's Files
Ask your partner to share their changes in one of these ways:
- **Option A**: Share their Git repository URL
- **Option B**: Share individual files (zip/rar)
- **Option C**: Share specific files they modified

### 2. Use the Merge Interface
1. Open `merge-interface.html` in your browser
2. Upload your partner's files
3. Click "Analyze Files" to see what's safe to merge
4. Review the analysis results

### 3. Start Safe Merging

#### For New Files (Safe to Add):
```bash
# Copy new files directly
cp partner-files/new-page.html ./
git add new-page.html
git commit -m "Add partner's new page"
```

#### For Modified Files (Need Review):
1. **HTML Files**: Compare section by section
2. **CSS Files**: Add new styles at the end
3. **JS Files**: Add new functions with unique names
4. **PHP Files**: Review carefully before merging

### 4. Test After Each Merge
```bash
# Test your website
# Check all functionality works
# If something breaks, rollback immediately
```

## 🛡️ Safety Commands

### If Something Goes Wrong:
```bash
# Return to your original work
git checkout backup-before-merge

# Or return to master
git checkout master
git reset --hard HEAD
```

### Check Current Status:
```bash
# See which branch you're on
git branch

# See what files changed
git status

# See recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```
